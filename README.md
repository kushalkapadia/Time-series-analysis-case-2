# Time-series-analysis-case-2

## Problem Description:

A small city XYZ has been taking record of its monthly electricity consumption (in kilowatt hours) for about
10 years from 1997. Meanwhile, the monthly maximum temperature (in degree C) has also been recorded.
The time series plots shown below indicate the varying of electricity consumption as well as temperature
from Jan. 1997 to Dec. 2006.

The data can be found here:


## Questions answered:

1) Use the Holt-Winter forecasting method to build a temperature forecasting model. Choose the best
exponential smoothing parameter.
2) Develop a seasonal ARIMA model for temperature. Please clearly describe each step of your model
building process. Compare this model with the model you found for Question 1), in terms of some
performance statistics including MSE, MAD, and MAPE.
3) Perform a spectral analysis of the temperature process to identify the significant frequency and make
explanation.
4) Develop a transfer function model to illustrate the change of electricity consumption with its relation to
the exogenous variable â€“ temperature. You may choose any temperature model developed for Question
1), 2) or 3). Please clearly describe each step of your model building process. Remember to show your
model adequacy checks.
5) Forecast the future streamflow of both monthly maximum temperature and electricity consumption for
the next 6 months after Jun. 2006.
